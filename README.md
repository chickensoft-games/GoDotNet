# GoDotNet

> Simple dependency injection, state management, serialization, and other utilities for C# Godot development.

GoDotNet is a library of code which (hopefully) makes using C# in Godot a little bit less painful.

While developing a game, we couldn't find any C# solutions to solve problems like dependency injection and simple state management. So, we built our own mechanisms (heavily inspired by other frameworks). It's now time to share this with the wider Godot community, since we will probably never finish our game anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

If you've used C# with Godot, you have probably realized it is a tricky environment to work in. GoDotNet aims to make all of that a lot easier.

### Requirements

You must specify C# 9, the correct target framework, and null-safety in your `*.csproj` file.

*If you're adding this to an existing project, you may face a considerable migration effort to make everything null safe.*

Use `netstandard2.1` instead of `net5.0` for the target framework (since there are [some issues][net-5-0] with `net5.0`).


```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>netstandard2.1</TargetFramework>
  <LangVersion>9.0</LangVersion>
  <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  <RootNamespace>YourProjectNamespace</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If you're using Steamworks.NET, you will likely need to add `<PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>`.

GoDotNet depends on a few other projects, which you can easily include in your game's `*.csproj` file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- Required to get certain things to build. -->
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CSharp" Version="4.7.0" />
  <!-- Used to support serialization for GDObjects -->
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Logging

GoDotNet provides a logging interface and a default implementation to make outputting to the console convenient in a debugging environment. For production environments, just make a different implementation that outputs to a log file (or does nothing).

```csharp
public class MyEntity {
  // Create a log which outputs messages prefixed with the name of the class.
  private ILog _log = new GDLog(nameof(MyClass));
}
```

Logs can perform a variety of common actions (and output messages if they fail automatically):

```csharp
_log.Print("My message");

_log.Warn("My message");

_log.Error("My message");

// Run a potentially unsafe action. Any errors thrown from the action will
// be output by the log. An optional error handler callback can be provided
// which will be invoked before the exception is rethrown.
_log.Run(
  () => { _log.Print("Potentially unsafe action"); },
  (e) => {
    _log.Error("Better clean up after myself...whatever I did failed.");
  }
);

// Throw an assertion exception with the given message if the assertion fails.
_log.Assert(node.Name == "MyNode", "Must be valid node name.");

// Return the value of a function or a fallback value.
var result = _log.Always<T>(
  () => new Random().Next(0, 10) > 5 ? "valid value" : null,
  "fallback value"
);

// Print a decently formatted stack trace.
_log.Print(new StackTrace());
```

### Extensions

GoDotNet provides a number of extensions on common Godot objects.
#### Godot Collections ‚ÜîÔ∏è Dotnet Collections

A Godot Dictionary or Array can be converted to a .NET collection easily in `O(n)` time. Certain [bugs][godot-dictionary-iterable-issue] in Godot's collection types necessitate the need for converting back-and-forth occasionally. For performance reasons, try to avoid doing this often on large collections.

```csharp
using Godot.Collections;

var array = new Array().ToDotNet();
var dictionary = new Dictionary<KeyType, ValueType>().ToDotNet();
```

#### Node Utilities

##### Autoloads

An autoload can be fetched from any node:

```csharp
public class MyEntity : Node {
  private MyAutoloadType _myAutoload = this.Autoload<MyAutoloadType>();

  public override void _Ready() {
    _myAutoload.DoSomething();
  }
}
```

##### Dependencies

Nodes can indicate that they require a certain type of value to be provided to them by any ancestor node above them in the scene tree.

GoDotNet's dependency system is [discussed in detail below](#dependency-injection).

To fetch a dependency:

```csharp
// Inside a Node subclass:
[Dependency]
private MyDependencyType _myDependency => this.DependOn<MyDependencyType>();
```

### Scheduling

A `Scheduler` node is included which allows callbacks to be run on the next frame, similar to [CallDeferred][call-deferred]. Unlike `CallDeferred`, the scheduler uses vanilla C# to avoid marshalling types to Godot. Since Godot cannot marshal objects that don't extend `Godot.Object`/`Godot.Reference`, this utility is provided to perform the same function for records, custom types, and C# collections which otherwise couldn't be marshaled between C# and Godot.

Create a new autoload which extends the scheduler:

```csharp
using GoDotNet;

public class GameScheduler : Scheduler { }
```

Add it to the `project.godot` file (preferably the first entry):

```ini
[autoload]

GameScheduler="*res://wherever_autoloads_are/GameScheduler.cs"
```

...and simply schedule a callback to run on the next frame:

```csharp
this.Autoload<Scheduler>().NextFrame(
  () => _log.Print("I won't execute until the next frame.")
)
```

### Dependency Injection

GoDotNet provides a simple dependency injection system which allows dependencies to be provided to child nodes, looked-up, cached, and read on demand. By `dependency`, we mean "any value or instance a node instance might need to perform its job." Oftentimes, dependencies are simply instances of custom classes (or other nodes) which perform game logic.

#### Why have a dependency system?

Why are dependencies helpful? Typically, providing values to nodes requires parent nodes to pass values to children nodes via method calls, following the ["call down, signal upwards"][call-down-signal-up] architecture rule. This creates a tight coupling between the parent and the child since the parent has to know which children need which values. If a distant descendant node of the parent also needs the same value, the parent's children have to pass it down until it reaches the correct descendent, too.

All of that requires a *lot* of boilerplate code and can result in unnecessary scripts being added to nodes which otherwise might not even need scripts. Additionally, doing all that work doesn't even guarantee that the descendants will have the most up-to-date value of the thing they need (unless you take care to create such a system).

GoDotNet's dependency system solves this by letting nodes indicate they provide values by implementing an interface, and letting the descendent nodes that need those values look for nodes above them that provide the values they need.

The dependent nodes don't actually care about what their ancestors are ‚Äî they just search for the closest node above them that can provide the value they need, ensuring loose coupling.

#### Providing and Fetching Dependencies

Providing values to nodes further down the tree is based on the idea of scoping dependencies, inspired by [popular systems][provider] in other frameworks that have already demonstrated their usefulness.

To create a node which provides a value to all of its descendant nodes, you must implement the `IProvider<T>` interface. `IProvider` requires a `Get()` method that returns an instance of the object it provides. `IProvider` also requires you to implement `IProviderNode`, which includes the `Provided()` method that you must call after all of the values you intend to provide have been initialized. Calling this allows dependent nodes to be informed when their dependency values are available for use.

```csharp
public class MySceneNode : IProvider<MyObject> {
  private MyObject _object = null!;

  // IProvider<MyObject> requires us to implement a single method:
  MyObject IProvider<MyObject>.Get() => _object;

  public override void _Ready() {
    _object = new MyObject();
    
    // Notify any dependencies that the values provided are now available.
    this.Provided();
  }
}
```

Once all of the values are initialized, you must call `OnProvided?.Invoke(this)` to inform any dependencies that the provided values are now available. You should only call the `OnProvided` event after all of the dependencies are non-null.

> `this.Provided` is necessary because `_Ready()` is called on child nodes *before* parent nodes due to [Godot's tree order][godot-tree-order]. If you try to use a dependency in a dependent node's `_Ready()` method, there's no guarantee that it's been created, which results in null exception errors. Since it's often not possible to create dependencies until `_Ready()`, provider nodes are expected to invoke `this.Provided()` once all of their provided values are created.

Nodes can provide multiple values just as easily. Below is a slightly more realistic example of a production use-case where the dependencies can't be created until `_Ready()`.

```csharp
public class MySceneNode : IProvider<MyObject>, IProvider<MyOtherObject> {
  // If this object has to be created on _Ready(), we can use `null!` since we
  // know the value will be present from thereon out. This is equivalent to
  // the `late` modifier in Dart or `lateinit` in Kotlin.
  private MyObject _object = null!;

  private MyOtherObject _otherObject = null!;

  MyObject IProvider<MyObject>.Get() => _object;
  MyOtherObject IProvider<MyOtherObject>.Get() => _otherObject;

  public override void _Ready() {
    _object = new MyObject(/* ... */);
    _otherObject = new MyOtherObject(/* ... */);

    // Notify any dependencies that the values provided are now available.
    this.Provided();
  }
}
```

To use dependencies, a node must implement `IDependent` and call `this.Depend()` in `_Ready()`. Once the underlying dependency resolution system determines that all of the dependencies are available from the provider node ancestors, the dependent node's `Loaded()` method will be called. In `Loaded()`, dependent nodes are guaranteed to be able to access their dependency values.

```csharp
public class MyNodeWhichRequiresADependency : Node, IDependent {
  // As long as there's a node which implements IProvider<MyObject> above us,
  // we will be able to access this object once `Loaded()` is called.
  [Dependency]
  private MyObject _object => this.DependOn<MyObject>();

  public override void _Ready() {
    // Required. This allows the dependency system to call Loaded() when all
    // of the dependencies this node depends on have been created by their
    // respective providers.
    this.Depend();

    // _object might actually be null here if the parent provider doesn't create
    // it in its constructor. Since many providers won't be creating 
    // dependencies until their _Ready() is invoked, which happens *after*
    // child node, we shouldn't reference dependencies in dependent nodes'
    // _Ready() methods. 
  }

  public void Loaded() {
    // This method is called by the dependency system when all of the provided
    // values we depend on have been finalized by their providers!
    //
    // For this method to be called, you must:
    //  1) Call `OnProvided?.Invoke(this)` in the providers.
    //  2) Call `this.Depend()` in the _Ready method of your dependent.
    //
    // _object is guaranteed to be initialized here!
    _object.DoSomething();
  }
}
```

All dependencies must be annotated with the `[Dependency]` attribute.

If you request a dependency from a node and the correct provider is implemented on any of the ancestor nodes, the autoloads will be searched for the correct provider. If one exists, it will be used instead.

#### Caveats

Like all dependency injection systems, there are a few corner cases you should be aware of.

If a node is removed from the tree and inserted somewhere else in the tree, it may not be able to find the correct provider. The underlying dependency system
will continue to use the previous provider it has cached. To prevent invalid
states, you should clear the dependency cache and recreate it when a node re-enters the tree. This can be accomplished by simply calling `this.Depend()` again from the dependent node, which will call `Loaded()` again.

```csharp
public override void _EnterTree() {
  // Reset dependency cache to avoid problems.
  this.Depend();
}
```

 By placing provider nodes above all the possible parents of a node which depends on that value, you can ensure that a node will always be able to find the dependency it requests. Clever provider hierarchies will prevent most of these headaches.
 
### State Machines

GoDotNet provides a simple state machine implementation that emits a C# event when the state changes (since [Godot signals are more fragile](#signals-and-events)). If you try to update the machine to a state that isn't a valid transition from the current state, it throws an exception. The machine requires that an initial state be given when the machine is constructed to avoid nullability issues.

State machines are not extensible ‚Äî instead, GoDotNet almost always prefers the pattern of [composition over inheritance][composition-inheritance]. The state machine relies on state equality to determine if the state has changed to avoid issuing unnecessary events. Using `record` types for the state allows this to happen automatically. 

States used with a state machine must implement IMachineState<T>, where T is just the type of the machine state. Otherwise, the default implementation returns `true` to allow transitions to any state.

States can optionally implement `CanTransitionTo(IMachineState state)` to determine if the proposed state transition is valid.

```csharp
public interface IGameState : IMachineState<IGameState> { }

public record GameMainMenuState : IGameState {
  public bool CanTransitionTo(IGameState state) => state is GameLoadingState;
}

public record GameLoadingState : IGameState {
  public bool CanTransitionTo(IGameState state) => state is GamePlayingState;
}

// States can store values!
public record GamePlayingState(string PlayerName) {
  public bool CanTransitionTo(IGameState state) => state is GameMainMenuState;
}
```

Machines are fairly simple to use: create one with an initial state (and optionally register a machine state change event handler). A state machine will announce the state has changed as soon as it is constructed.

```csharp
public class GameManager : Node {
  private readonly Machine<IGameState> _machine;

  // Expose the machine's event.
  public event Machine<IGameState>.Changed OnChanged {
    add => _machine.OnChanged += value;
    remove => _machine.OnChanged -= value;
  }

  public override void _Ready() {
    _machine = new Machine<IGameState>(new GameMainMenuState(), onChanged);
  }

  /// <summary>Starts the game.</summary>
  public void Start(string name) {
    _machine.Update(new GameLoadingState());
    // do your loading...
    // ...
    // start the game!
    _machine.Update(new GamePlayingState(name);
  }

  /// <summary>Goes back to the menu.</summary>
  public void GoToMenu() => _machine.Update(new GameMainMenuState());

  public void OnChanged(IGameState state) {
    if (state is GamePlayingState playingState) {
      var playerName = playingState.Name();
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Notifiers

A notifier is an object which emits a signal when its value changes. Notifiers are similar to state machines, but they don't care about transitions. Any update that changes the value (determined by comparing the new value with the previous value using `Object.Equals`) will emit a signal. It's often convenient to use record types as the value of a Notifier. Like state machines, the value of a notifier can never be `null` ‚Äî¬†make sure you initialize with a valid value!

Because notifiers check equality to determine changes, they are convenient to use with value types (like primitives and structs). Notifiers, like state machines, also emit a signal to announce their value as soon as they are constructed.

```csharp
private var _notifier
  = new Notifier<string>("Player", OnPlayerNameChanged);

private void OnPlayerNameChanged(string name) {
  _log.Print($"Player name changed to $name");
}
```

Like state machines, notifiers should typically be kept private. Instead of letting consumers modify the value directly, you can create a manager class which provides methods that mutate the notifier value. These manager classes can provide an event which redirects to the notifier event, or they can emit their own events when certain pieces of the notifier value changes.

```csharp
public record EnemyData(string Name, int Health);

public class EnemyManager {
  private readonly Notifier<EnemyData> _notifier;

  public event Notifier<EnemyData>.Changed OnChanged {
    add => _notifier.OnChanged += value;
    remove => _notifier.OnChanged -= value;
  }

  public EnemyData Value => _notifier.Value;

  public EnemyManager(string name, int health) => _notifier = new(
    new EnemyData(name, health)
  );

  public void UpdateName(string name) =>
    _notifier.Value = _notifier.Value with { Name = name };

  public void UpdateHealth(int health) =>
    _notifier.Value = _notifier.Value with { Health = health };
}
```

The class above shows an enemy manager which manages a single enemy's state and emits an `OnChanged` event whenever any part of the enemy's state changes. You can easily modify it to emit more specific events when certain pieces of the enemy state changes.

```csharp
public class EnemyManager {
  private readonly Notifier<EnemyData> _notifier;

  public EnemyData Value => _notifier.Value;

  public event Action<string>? OnNameChanged;
  public event Action<int>? OnHealthChanged;

  public EnemyManager(string name, int health) => _notifier = new(
    new EnemyData(name, health),
    OnChanged
  );

  public void UpdateName(string name) =>
    _notifier.Value = _notifier.Value with { Name = name };

  public void UpdateHealth(int health) =>
    _notifier.Value = _notifier.Value with { Health = health };

  private void OnChanged(EnemyData enemy, EnemyData? previous) {
    // Emit different events depending on what changed.
    if (!System.Object.Equals(enemy.Name, previous?.Name)) {
      OnNameChanged?.Invoke(enemy.Name);
    }
    else if (!System.Object.Equals(enemy.Health, previous?.Health)) {
      OnHealthChanged?.Invoke(enemy.Health);
    }
  }
}
```

By providing manager classes which wrap state machines or notifiers to dependent nodes, you can create nodes which easily respond to changes in the values provided by distant ancestor nodes.

### Serialization of Godot Objects

GoDotNet provides a `GDObject` which extends `Godot.Reference` (which is itself a `Godot.Object`). Because it is a `Godot.Object`, `GDObject` can be marshalled back and forth between Godot's C++ layer without any issue, provided each of its fields is also a type that Godot supports.

GoDotNet takes this a step further and offers basic dictionary serialization for GDObjects using the popular `Newtonsoft.Json` package (if you use the appropriate annotations for constructors and fields).

When extending `GDObject` or `Godot.Object`, it is imperative to offer a default constructor with no parameters. Godot uses this default constructor [to create a default value for exported fields][export-default-values] in the editor.

```csharp
public class MyObject : GDObject {

  // Init properties are a great way to keep things immutable on GDObject.
  // Marking this with [JsonProperty] allows it to be serialized using 
  // Newtonsoft.Json.
  [JsonProperty]
  public string PlayerName { get; init; }

  // Default constructor to keep Godot happy.
  public MyObject() {
    PlayerName = default;
  }

  // Tell Newtonsoft.Json to use this constructor for deserialization.
  [JsonConstructor]
  public MyObject(string playerName) {
    PlayerName = playerName;
  }
}
```

To serialize and deserialize a `GDObject` to and from a dictionary, respectively, you can use the static methods on `GDObject.`

```csharp
var alice = new MyObject("Alice");
Dictionary<string, object?> data = GDObject.ToData(alice);
MyObject aliceAgain = GDObject.FromData(data);
```

Likewise, if you are convinced each key and value in the `GDObject` is string convertible, you can serialize the model to a `Dictionary<string, string>`. This is helpful when passing data around for Steamworks lobbies, for example.

```csharp
var bob = new MyObject("Bob");
Dictionary<string, string> stringData = GDObject.ToStringData(bob);
MyObject bobAgain = GDObject.FromStringData(stringData);
```

### Technical Challenges

#### Signals and Events

Godot supports emitting [signals] from C#. Because Godot signals pass through the Godot engine, any arguments given to the signal must be marshalled through Godot, forcing them to be classes which extend `Godot.Object`/`Godot.Reference` (structs aren't allowed). Likewise, all the fields in the class must also be the same kind of types so they can be marshalled, and so on.

It's not possible to have static typing with signal parameters, so you don't find out until runtime if you accidentally passed the wrong parameter. The closest you can do is the following, which wouldn't break at compile time if the receiving function signature happened to be wrong.

```csharp
public class ObjectType {
  [Signal]
  public delegate void DoSomething(string value); 
}

public class MyNode : Node {
  // Inside your node
  public override void _Ready() {
    _ = object.Connect(
      nameof(ObjectType.DoSomething),
      this,
      nameof(MyDoSomething)
    );
  }

  private void DoSomething(int value) {
    // WARNING: Value should be string, not int!!
  }
}
```

Because of these limitations, GoDotNet will avoid Godot signals except when necessary to interact with Godot components. For communication between C# game logic, it will typically be preferable to use C# events instead.

```csharp
// Declare an event signature ‚Äî no [Signal] attribute necessary.
public delegate void Changed(Type1 value1, Type2 value2);

// Add an event field to your emitter
public event Changed? OnChanged;

// Trigger an event from your emitter:
OnChanged?.Invoke(argument1, argument2);

// Listen to an event in your receiver:
var emitter = new MyEmitterObject();
emitter.OnChanged += MyOnChangedHandler;

// Event handler in your receiver:
private void MyOnChangedHandler(Type1 value1, Type2 value2) {
  // respond to event we received
}
```
